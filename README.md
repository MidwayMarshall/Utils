# MatheusDev's Utils

## What is this?

This is a collection of useful classes in java, without dependencies to outer libs, except the standard java lib.

## What does it have?

Currently, the following stuff is implemented:
* "Matrix" -> Array mapping for N dimensions.
* Optimized 2D and 3D versions of the above.
* A "javatemplater", which was used to create the Matrix->Array Mapping classes.
* 1D Simplex Noise.
* Simplex Noise for N Dimensions.
* 1D Value Noise.
* Helper for writing Gif-Animations to files.
* A bunch of other Utilities, like FrameUtils, for positioning java.awt.Frame's in the mid of a desired screen, GriddedImage to create png-Image grids for SpriteSheets, NumUtils and SleepUtils, and a TextFileReaer.
